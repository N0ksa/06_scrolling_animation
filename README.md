# 06_scrolling_animation

Simple project made with html/css and javascript. When you scroll the page new elements appear with smooth animation.
When scrolling up elements are removed. 

In the background all elements are present inside html document, but they are positioned to the sides of viewport with 
css translateX() function. They are animated using css transition property.
Javascript is used to decide the triger point, more precisely to add/remove class to the element when in 
adequate position.
